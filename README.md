# List-all-AE-plugins
An AppleScript to get a list of Adobe After Effects plugins.
Replace [version] with 2018 or 2019, etc.

There is a command key shortcut to do this its “Command+Option+Shift+Help,” but there is no help key on new keyboards and I don’t think there ever was on laptops. You can also remap the help key to something else, but when you are dealing with multiple computers that can be kind of a pain. So I wrote this simple script.
